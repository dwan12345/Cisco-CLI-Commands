# Notes from conversation with marcus
- marcus did his interview via persidio, no interview with client. the other guy got rolled off. something about his planning/documentation was not good enough, Marcus did not know the specifics. my interview will most likely be with the client
- CAB is a big deal. CAB meeting is much shorter, you just tell them what you are changing and people ask you questions. 
- they are manufacturing industry, so for any changes, bring the devices up in parallel, so there is very minimal downtime
- they are looking for someone with technical communication skills. talk about what I have done in a technical way
- project is: refreshing switches, access points. not much firewall stuff for me/marcus
- the devices are cisco 9600 for the core. 9500 at distribution. 9200/9300 at access, nexus 9k
- know about OSPF, STP, port channels
- know stuff about documentation, communication, planning
- probably talking with one of the managers. the manager will probably ask about my resume
