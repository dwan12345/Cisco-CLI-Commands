# Infoblox Project
I had significant experience configuring and managing core network services including DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, and NTP. We utilized a hybrid environment, leveraging both **Infoblox appliances** and **Microsoft Windows Servers** for these critical functions.

**Specifically regarding Infoblox, we had a redundant pair setup,** which was crucial for maintaining high availability. I was responsible for the initial configuration, ensuring the two appliances were properly synchronized and that failover mechanisms were thoroughly tested. This involved configuring DHCP scopes and NTP settings along with integrating them with our Active Directory environment to centralize access control.

On the **Microsoft side**, I regularly managed DNS records, and Active Directory objects, including user accounts, and group policies. I also configured and maintained NTP services on our domain controllers, ensuring accurate time synchronization across the network, which is vital for Kerberos authentication and overall system integrity.

# SIC
I have direct experience designing highly redundant networks for a client's head quarters. It was a 2 tier design to reduce costs. Special considerations were made to ensure that there were no single point of failure. To ensure this, I used protocols such as HSRP, etherchannel, and palo alto HA. Of course I also had to take into account the specific needs of the client, such as having edge firewalls, their existing network appliances, and confining their finance department. The network used Palo Alto Edge firewalls, so I used a virtual router for the finance department to isolate their subnet.
