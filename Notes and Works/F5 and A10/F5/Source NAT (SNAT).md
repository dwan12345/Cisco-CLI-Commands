- when the F5 forwards a client's traffic to a server, usually the source IP is the client's IP. This causes issues because if the server's default gateway is not the F5, then the server will forward the traffic out of NOT the F5, and when the client receives it back, it will not know where it came from
- to solve the issue, when the F5 forwards traffic to the server, SNAT replaces the source IP of the packet to the internal self IP of the F5. It will then translate it back when it forwards the response to the client
