- find out the business goals
	- will it grow?
	- are there mission critical applications or users?
	- how much downtime can we afford?
	- budget?
- internet circuits
	- do we need 99.99% uptime from our ISP, or just a normal broadband?
	- what type of handoff is it? fiber? RJ45?
	- where is the minimum point of entry?
	- for redundant ISPs, try to get circuits that operate at different PoP, and more path diversity. but this is often not possible
