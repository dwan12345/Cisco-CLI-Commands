# Doing Stuff No Downtime
- using DNS to perform cutovers
- using HA clustering to minimize downtime
- using features of the hardware itself, such as double route processors, to minimize downtime


# Lambo Questions
- are documentation up to date? ask your peers at the company
- should I spend time learning automation? yes, if you have time. but companies will use wildly different ways to do automation
- in wireless, how do you account for super high density places? places with more people, add more access points
- is packet size of the applications being used relevant in planning a modern wireless environment? not that important
- first weeks of contract - asking for documentation. asking for meetings to be sitting in and shadowing. figure out their workflow process, how they communicate, how they do meetings. once you get your access, figure out your first deliverables. 
- what should I avoid doing while on contract - don't be quiet, don't be afraid to say stupid stuff, talk to people, offer ideas. do not look like you are just trying to do the minimum. ask why they did the network this way. when you make a mistake, talk to the escalation team.
- when you get a new project: write down all questions, walk away for an hour, write down all new questions, then email it.
