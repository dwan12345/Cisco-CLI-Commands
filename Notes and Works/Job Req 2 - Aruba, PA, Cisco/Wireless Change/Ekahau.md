- import a CAD file or PNG. if PNG, then you need to modify the scales
- create buildings. within each build, create floors
- floors can be separated by a literal floor in the map, which can have different attenuation values like walls do
- floors can be logically connected connected at the stairs using some sort of point
- create areas that need wifi coverage
- define the minimum values needed such as throughput and signal strength
- use Auto Planner to automatically place APs
- can change which APs you are using
- can change the "show" to see different heat maps, such as signal strength, how many APs reach this area, the channels being used, etc.
