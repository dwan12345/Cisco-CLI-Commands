1. Identify the problem
	- what is the expected behavior, how to replicate the issue, when did it start
2. establish a theory of probable cause
	- narrow the scope of the issue. where is the traffic getting dropped? is it just a subnet? 
	- use tracert and packet tracer
	- check the logs
	- confirm the configurations
3. test the theory
4. establish a plan of action, then implement
5. verify the problem has been solved
6. document findings, actions, outcomes


When you're reading these case studies, pay attention to:

- **The initial symptoms:** How was the problem first identified?
    
- **The troubleshooting methodology:** What steps did the engineers take? Did they follow a systematic approach (e.g., top-down, bottom-up)?
    
- **The tools used:** Which commands, software, or hardware tools were essential for diagnosis? (e.g., ping, traceroute, nslookup, Wireshark, tcpdump)
    
- **The root cause:** What was the underlying issue?
    
- **The resolution:** How was the problem fixed?
    
- **Lessons learned:** What insights did the engineers gain from the experience?
